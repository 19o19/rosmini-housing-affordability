                    <p class="card-paragraph">Recent reports from Barfoot & Thompson (Q4 2023 / Q3 2024) indicate that Auckland's average weekly rent has continued to rise significantly. For example, in December 2023, the average weekly rent reached $662.23, marking a 5.27% increase year-on-year. This continuous upward trend puts increasing financial strain on many households, with housing costs consuming a substantial portion of income.

                    <p class="card-paragraph">
                        Auckland continues to face significant housing affordability challenges for homeownership. As of December 2024, CoreLogic New Zealand reported Auckland's median property value was 7.9 times the median annual household income. While this is an improvement from previous peaks, it remains well above the 'affordable' benchmark of three times income, making saving for a deposit and securing a mortgage extremely difficult for many, including young families.

                    <p class="card-paragraph">
                        Household crowding remains a significant issue in Auckland. Stats NZ (2023 Census data) reported that over 100,000 households (around 1 in 16) experienced crowded living conditions in New Zealand. Auckland specifically accounts for almost half of all crowded households in the country, with areas like Māngere-Ōtāhuhu and Ōtara-Papatoetoe showing very high rates. Overcrowding is linked to increased risks of infectious diseases and can negatively impact children's well-being and educational outcomes due to a lack of quiet study spaces.
