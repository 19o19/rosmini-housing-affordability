                    <p class="section-paragraph">
                        Housing affordability is a critical issue when a significant portion of a household's income is spent on housing costs (rent or mortgage), leaving little for other necessities like food, transport, and healthcare. In Auckland, this has become a growing concern, impacting individuals, families, and the overall well-being of our community. For many, finding a safe, warm, and affordable home close to work or school is an increasing struggle.
                    </p>
                <p class="section-paragraph"> This issue isn't just about high house prices; it's also about rising rental costs, stagnant wages, and the limited supply of suitable housing. When housing is unaffordable, it can lead to overcrowding, long commutes, stress, and even homelessness, directly affecting families within and connected to the Rosmini community. Understanding the scale of this challenge is the first step towards finding sustainable solutions.
